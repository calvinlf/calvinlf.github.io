    <h1>Vallahirstead</h1>
    <p>In the North of the Forsaken Lands, even more North than the Shio, lies vallahirstead, the shattered city.
        Called both the shattered city and the violet city for the floating amethyst shards that float of above city,
        this city hosts not one, but three of the greatest centers of magical learning.
        Vallahirstead was once only an outpost of Krandel, but after that nation was overrun by demons in 506 ANW,
        it became a city state, powerful in its own right.
        At the center of the city lies a lake that is held by the bottom half of an enormous amethyst geode,
        the source of the magical floating rock.
        Despite the cold, the lake never freezes over.
        This is not all that strange though, for wizards fly through the sky on flying carpets,
        and even the lowliest of storekeepers knows a bit of magic.
